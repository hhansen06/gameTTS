This software is a neural network, which is able to imitate voices from well-known computer games, is published under [CC-BY-NC 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/legalcode). 

# Copyright
lexkoro used audio files embedded into commercial games. He trained a neuronal network out of these files. I'm quite shure, using this network in any kind of commercial environment, is an infringement of copyright.

# Usage
- git clone https://github.com/hhansen06/gameTTS.git 
- cd gameTTS

- goto http://ADDROFSERVER:5000/ 
- have fun ;)
